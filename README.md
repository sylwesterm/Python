Python (small projects)

## Description
This repository contains small projects that I have done in Python. The projects are:
- [x] [battery_pytorch](battery_pytorch): A simple example of a neural network using PyTorch to predict the remaining useful life of a battery.
- [x] [cord](cord): Example of Python application that calculates whether a vehicle is outside of the planned route. The application uses Haversine formula algorithm.
- [x] [battery](battery): A simple example of a neural network using Keras to predict the remaining useful life of a battery.
- [x] [servicebus](servicebus): Example of Python application that sends and receives messages from Azure Service Bus.
- [x] [nlp](nlp): Example of Python application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of a text.
